                  the scattered code within the implementation of
                  Globus Toolkit, the widespread middleware providing
                  support for Grid computing.  The core
                  functionalities of Globus Toolkit are implemented as
                  a big number of C source files.  The analysis of
                  Globus Toolkit has shown that calls to functions
                  handling output, errors, synchronisation and memory
                  have the highest values of fan-in and are the most
                  scattered.}

  abstract = 	 {Live programming environments are the programming editors that immediately shows results of an execution of a program being edited. The immediate feedback can change the way of programming---we can exercise a more trial-and-error style of programming, and we can be more confident of the code fragments that we are writing. So far, most of live programming environments are developed for education or for artistic performance. In order to apply live programming for practical software development, we still need overcome several issues, such as visualization, user interface, and runtime performance. This talk presents our live programming environment, called Kanon, that automatically visualizes data structures created inside of a program. We discuss interesting problems and solutions for making visualization natural to the programmers, and remaining challenges.},
