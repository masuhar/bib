                  the scattered code within the implementation of
                  Globus Toolkit, the widespread middleware providing
                  support for Grid computing.  The core
                  functionalities of Globus Toolkit are implemented as
                  a big number of C source files.  The analysis of
                  Globus Toolkit has shown that calls to functions
                  handling output, errors, synchronisation and memory
                  have the highest values of fan-in and are the most
                  scattered.}

  abstract = 	 {Context-oriented programming (COP) languages provide a modularization mechanism called a layer, which modularizes behaviors that are executable under specific contexts, and specify a way to dynamically switch behaviors. However, the correspondence between real-world contexts and units of behavioral variations is not simple. Thus, in existing COP languages, context-related concerns can easily be tangled within a piece of layer activation code. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a new construct called a composite layer, which declares a proposition in which ground terms are given other layer names (true when active). A composite layer is active only when the proposition is true. We introduce this construct into EventCJ, out COP language, and verify this approach by conducting two case studies involving a context-aware Twitter client and a program editor. The results obtained in our approach show that the layer activation code is simple and free from tangled context-related concerns. We also discuss the efficient implementation of this mechanism in EventCJ.}

  abstract="In widely-used actor-based programming languages, such as Erlang, sequential execution performance is as important as scalability of concurrency. In order to improve sequential performance of Erlang, we develop Pyrlang, an Erlang virtual machine with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler by applying an existing meta-tracing JIT compiler. In this paper, we overview our implementation and present the optimization techniques for Erlang programs, most of which heavily rely on function recursion. Our preliminary evaluation showed approximately 38{\%} speedup over the standard Erlang interpreter.",

The immediate feedback can change the way of programming---we can exercise a more trial-and-error style of programming, and we can be more confident of the code fragments that we are writing. So far, most of live programming environments are developed for education or for artistic performance. In order to apply live programming for practical software development, we still need overcome several issues, such as visualization, user interface, and runtime performance. This talk presents our live programming environment, called Kanon, that automatically visualizes data structures created inside of a program. We discuss interesting problems and solutions for making visualization natural to the programmers, and remaining challenges.},
