                  concern is scattered among modules implementing some
                  existing software systems.  This paper investigates
                  the scattered code within the implementation of
                  Globus Toolkit, the widespread middleware providing
                  support for Grid computing.  The core
                  functionalities of Globus Toolkit are implemented as
                  a big number of C source files.  The analysis of
                  Globus Toolkit has shown that calls to functions
                  handling output, errors, synchronisation and memory
                  have the highest values of fan-in and are the most
                  scattered.}

                  possible extensions to ContextJ to improve its

                  to simulate different execution environment, and so
