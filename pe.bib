		We present the design of DyC, a dynamic-compilation
		  system for C based on run-time
		  specialization. Directed by a few declarative user
		  annotations that specify the variables and code on
		  which dynamic compilation should take place, a
		  binding-time analysis computes the set of run-time
		  constants at each program point in the annotated
		  procedure's control-flow graph; the analysis
		  supports program- point-specific polyvariant
		  division and specialization. The results of the
		  analysis guide the construction of a run-time
		  specializer for each dynamically compiled region;
		  the specializer supports various caching strategies
		  for managing dynamically generated code and mixes of
		  speculative and demand-driven specialization of
		  dynamic branch successors. Most of the key
		  cost/benefit trade-offs in the binding-time analysis
		  and the run-time specializer are open to user
		  control through declarative policy annotations.  

		DyC has been implemented in the context of an
		  optimizing compiler, and initial results have been
		  promising. The speedups we have obtained are good,
		  and the dynamic-compilation overhead is among the
		  lowest of any dynamic-compilation system, typically
		  20-200 cycles per instruction generated on a Digital
		  Alpha 21064. The majority of DyC's functionality has
		  been used to dynamically compile an instruction-set
		  simulator. Only three annotations were required, but
		  a few other changes to the program had to be made
		  due to DyC's lack of support for static global
		  variables. This deficiency and DyC's rudimentary
		  support for partially static data structures are the
		  primary obstacles to making DyC easy to use.
