The programmer specifies the property separately from the program; a program transformer takes the program and the property and automatically produces another “equivalent” pogram satisfying the property. This separation of concerns makes the program easier to develop and maintain. Our approach is both static and dynamic. It integrates static analyses in order to avoid useless transformations. On the other hand, it never rejects programs but adds dynamic checks when necessary. An important challenge is to make this dynamic enforcement as inexpensive as possible. The most obvious application domain is the enforcement of security policies. In particular, a potential use of the method is the securization of mobile code upon receipt.

		  class, an object is automatically an instance of a
		  predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
		  expression associated with the predicate class. The
		  predicate expression can test the value or state of
		  the object, thus supporting a form of implicit
		  property-based classification that augments the
		  explicit type-based classification provided by
		  normal classes. By associating methods with
		  predicate classes, method lookup can depend not only
		  on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
		  dynamic value or state. If an object is modified,
		  the property-based classification of an object can
		  change over time, implementing shifts in major
		  behavior modes of the object. A version of predicate
		  classes has been designed and implemented in the
		  context of the Cecil language."

     Abstract: This paper describes a modified form of Kohlbecker's algorithm for
     reliably hygienic (capture-free) macro expansion in block-structured languages.
     Unlike previous algorithms, the modified algorithm runs in linear instead of
     quadratic [or exponential] time, copies few constants, does not assume that
     syntactic keywords (e.g. if) are reserved words, and allows local (scoped) macros
     to refer to lexical variables in a referentially transparent manner.

  abstract = "MapReduce is a programming model and an associated
implementation for processing and generating large
data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a
key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
values associated with the same intermediate key. Many
real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown
in the paper.
Programs written in this functional style are automatically
parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity
machines. The run-time system takes care of the
details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's
execution across a set of machines, handling machine
failures, and managing the required inter-machine
communication. This allows programmers without any
experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily
utilize the resources of a large distributed system.
Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large
cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable:
a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes
of data on thousands of machines. Programmers
nd the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs
have been implemented and upwards of one thousand
MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters
every day."

It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients. 

While sharing many of the same goals as previous distributed file systems, our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and technological environment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and explore radically different design points. 

The file system has successfully met our storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google as the storage platform for the generation and processing of data used by our service as well as research and development efforts that require large data sets. The largest cluster to date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. 

In this paper, we present file system interface extensions designed to support distributed applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real world use. "

	Abstract.  The monadic style of language specification has the
		  advantages of modularity and extensibility: it is
		  simple to add or change features in an interpreter
		  to reflect modifications in the source language. It
		  has proven difficult to extend the method to
		  compilation. We demonstrate that by introducing
		  machine-like stores (code and data) into the monadic
		  semantics and then partially evaluating the
		  resulting semantic expressions, we can achieve many
		  of the same advantages for a compiler as for an
		  interpreter. A number of language constructs and
		  features are compiled: expressions, CBV and CBN
		  evaluation of lambda-expressions, dynamic scoping,
		  and various imperative features. The treatment of
		  recursive procedures is outlined as well. The
		  resulting method allows compilers to be constructed
		  in a mix-and-match fashion just as in a
		  monad-structured interpreter."

Abstract. DJ is a new pure-Java library for adaptive programming that allows traversal strategies to be constructed and interpreted dynamically at run-time, as opposed to existing adaptive programming tools that are strictly static. Traversal strategies can be used with adaptive visitors (similar to the Visitor pattern) or in a generic programming style by adapting them to the Java Collections framework. The DJ library makes heavy use of Java reflection and we give some details of this implementation. },

		  incrementally and to write important applications

		  trade dynamic compilation speed for dynamic code
		  quality: in some aplications, it is most important
		  to generate code quickly, while in others code
		  quality matters more than compilation speed. The
		  overhead of dynamic compilation is on the order of
		  100 to 600 cycles per generated instruction,
		  depending on the level of dynamic
		  optimizaton. Measurements show that the use of
		  dynamic code generation can improve performance by
		  almost an order of magnitude; two- to four-fold
		  speedups are common. In most cases, the overhead of
		  dynamic compilation is recovered in under 100 uses
		  of the dynamic code; sometimes it can be recovered
		  within one use."

		ABSTRACT. Active networks represent a new
		  approach to network architecture. Routers can
		  perform computations on user data, while packets can
		  carry programs to be executed on routers and
		  possibly change their state. Currently, the research
		  community is divided concerning the usefulness of
		  active networks. On the one hand, active networks
		  provide a much more flexible network infrastructure,
		  with increased capabilities. On the other hand, they
		  are obviously more complex than traditional networks
		  and raise considerable security issues. The purpose
		  of this article is to provide a broad survey on
		  active networks. The first goal is to highlight
		  their efficiency in a variety of applications. After
		  presenting some key points on each application, we
		  discuss some current experimental technologies and
		  assess the usefulness of active networks in
		  congestion control, multicasting, caching, and
		  network management. The second goal is to address
		  the security issues that active networks raise: the
		  problem is defined, and techniques for solving it
		  are presented and elaborated upon with a description
		  of a specific implementation of a secure environment
		  and related performance measures. Issues related to
		  the design of a programming language for active
		  networks are also discussed. The third goal is to
		  classify active network architectures based on their
		  design approach. Thus an inclusive presentation of
		  currently proposed architectures, which focuses on
		  their design attributes, capabilities, performance,
		  and security, is given. "

		      large-scale refinements in terms of a fundamental

		      collaborations can be expressed in existing

		      language constructs (which we have implemented as
		      extensions to the Java language). We present a

		      called mixin layers, and demonstrate how it
		      overcomes the scalability difficulties that
		      plagued prior work. We also show how we used mixin
		      layers as the primary implementation technique for
		      building an extensible Java compiler, JTS.}

abstract={
The actor model is a natural starting point for a semantic theory that
treats both heterogeneity and modularity (encapsulation and
composability) in distributed systems.  This paper begins with some
simple examples of actor systems that illustrate the essential
features of actor based computation, and the interactions and
combinations of components these systems.  We then present a semantic
theory that formalizes these notions.  A notion of abstract actor
structure (AAS) is introduced that characterizes the minimal semantic
requirements for an actor language and allows for components to be
defined using multiple languages.  Next, a modular operational
semantics is derived from the local rules for behavior of individual
actors given in an AAS.  This semantics accounts for both internal
computation and interaction of a component with its environment.  Next
we abstract away from details of internal computation and define a
notion of interaction semantics.  This allows us to reason about
equivalence of actor system components considered as black boxes.
Finally, an algebra of components and their interaction semantics is
defined.  This provides a basis for reasoning about construction and
transformation of components implemented as actor systems.

		abstract. The introduction of parametric polymorphism
		  in Java with translation approaches has been shown
		  to be of considerable interest, allowing the
		  definition of extensions of Java on top of the
		  existing Virtual Machines. Homogeneous translations
		  furthermore, seem to be more useful than
		  heterogeneous, avoiding the continuous increase of
		  library code with redundant information. At this
		  time however, homogeneous approaches aren't as
		  flexible as heterogeneous, with extensions failing
		  to integrate well with base language typing. In this
		  paper, using some of the features of the Core
		  Reflection of Java, we introduce a homogeneous
		  translation in which run-time information about
		  instantiation of type-parameters is carried,
		  allowing full integration of parameterized types
		  with Java typing. Performance overhead is highly
		  decreased using a brand new translation technique
		  based on the deferring of the management of type
		  information at load-time. The same power and
		  flexibility of previous heterogeneous approaches is
		  obtained while maintaining homogeneous translation
		  advantages. "

                  embodied in AspectJ, is the use of _advice_ to
                  incrementally modify the  behavior of a program.  An
                  advice declaration specifies an action to be taken
                  whenever some condition arises during the execution
                  of the  program.  The condition is specified by a
                  formula called a  _pointcut designator_ or
                  _pcd_. The events during  execution at which advice
                  may be triggered are called _join points_.  In
                  this model of aspect-oriented programming, join
                  points are dynamic in that they refer to events
                  during the execution of the program. 
  
                  We give a denotational semantics for a minilanguage
                  that embodies the key features of dynamic join
                  points, pointcut designators, and advice.},
