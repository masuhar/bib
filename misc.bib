		  class, an object is automatically an instance of a
		  predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
		  expression associated with the predicate class. The
		  predicate expression can test the value or state of
		  the object, thus supporting a form of implicit
		  property-based classification that augments the
		  explicit type-based classification provided by
		  normal classes. By associating methods with
		  predicate classes, method lookup can depend not only
		  on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
		  dynamic value or state. If an object is modified,
		  the property-based classification of an object can
		  change over time, implementing shifts in major
		  behavior modes of the object. A version of predicate
		  classes has been designed and implemented in the
		  context of the Cecil language."

     Abstract: This paper describes a modified form of Kohlbecker's algorithm for
     reliably hygienic (capture-free) macro expansion in block-structured languages.
     Unlike previous algorithms, the modified algorithm runs in linear instead of
     quadratic [or exponential] time, copies few constants, does not assume that
     syntactic keywords (e.g. if) are reserved words, and allows local (scoped) macros
     to refer to lexical variables in a referentially transparent manner.

	Abstract.  The monadic style of language specification has the
		  advantages of modularity and extensibility: it is
		  simple to add or change features in an interpreter
		  to reflect modifications in the source language. It
		  has proven difficult to extend the method to
		  compilation. We demonstrate that by introducing
		  machine-like stores (code and data) into the monadic
		  semantics and then partially evaluating the
		  resulting semantic expressions, we can achieve many
		  of the same advantages for a compiler as for an
		  interpreter. A number of language constructs and
		  features are compiled: expressions, CBV and CBN
		  evaluation of lambda-expressions, dynamic scoping,
		  and various imperative features. The treatment of
		  recursive procedures is outlined as well. The
		  resulting method allows compilers to be constructed
		  in a mix-and-match fashion just as in a
		  monad-structured interpreter."

		  C that supports efficient and high-level use of
		  dynamic code generation. 'C provides dynamic code
		  generation at the level of C expressions and
		  statements and supports the composition of dynamic
		  code at run time. These features enable programmers
		  to add dynamic code generation to existing C code
		  incrementally and to write important applications
		  (such as ``just-in-time'' compilers) easily. The
		  article presents many examples of how 'C can be used
		  to solve practical problems. The tcc compiler is an
		  efficient, portable, and freely available
		  implementation of 'C. tcc allows programmers to
		  trade dynamic compilation speed for dynamic code
		  quality: in some aplications, it is most important
		  to generate code quickly, while in others code
		  quality matters more than compilation speed. The
		  overhead of dynamic compilation is on the order of
		  100 to 600 cycles per generated instruction,
		  depending on the level of dynamic
		  optimizaton. Measurements show that the use of
		  dynamic code generation can improve performance by
		  almost an order of magnitude; two- to four-fold
		  speedups are common. In most cases, the overhead of
		  dynamic compilation is recovered in under 100 uses
		  of the dynamic code; sometimes it can be recovered
		  within one use."

abstract={
The actor model is a natural starting point for a semantic theory that
treats both heterogeneity and modularity (encapsulation and
composability) in distributed systems.  This paper begins with some
simple examples of actor systems that illustrate the essential
features of actor based computation, and the interactions and
combinations of components these systems.  We then present a semantic
theory that formalizes these notions.  A notion of abstract actor
structure (AAS) is introduced that characterizes the minimal semantic
requirements for an actor language and allows for components to be
defined using multiple languages.  Next, a modular operational
semantics is derived from the local rules for behavior of individual
actors given in an AAS.  This semantics accounts for both internal
computation and interaction of a component with its environment.  Next
we abstract away from details of internal computation and define a
notion of interaction semantics.  This allows us to reason about
equivalence of actor system components considered as black boxes.
Finally, an algebra of components and their interaction semantics is
defined.  This provides a basis for reasoning about construction and
transformation of components implemented as actor systems.
