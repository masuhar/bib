		  class, an object is automatically an instance of a
		  predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
		  expression associated with the predicate class. The
		  predicate expression can test the value or state of
		  the object, thus supporting a form of implicit
		  property-based classification that augments the
		  explicit type-based classification provided by
		  normal classes. By associating methods with
		  predicate classes, method lookup can depend not only
		  on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
		  dynamic value or state. If an object is modified,
		  the property-based classification of an object can
		  change over time, implementing shifts in major
		  behavior modes of the object. A version of predicate
		  classes has been designed and implemented in the
		  context of the Cecil language."

. . In Proceedings of the 1991
ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, pages . 

     Abstract: This paper describes a modified form of Kohlbecker's algorithm for
     reliably hygienic (capture-free) macro expansion in block-structured languages.
     Unlike previous algorithms, the modified algorithm runs in linear instead of
     quadratic [or exponential] time, copies few constants, does not assume that
     syntactic keywords (e.g. if) are reserved words, and allows local (scoped) macros
     to refer to lexical variables in a referentially transparent manner.

	Abstract.  The monadic style of language specification has the
		  advantages of modularity and extensibility: it is
		  simple to add or change features in an interpreter
		  to reflect modifications in the source language. It
		  has proven difficult to extend the method to
		  compilation. We demonstrate that by introducing
		  machine-like stores (code and data) into the monadic
		  semantics and then partially evaluating the
		  resulting semantic expressions, we can achieve many
		  of the same advantages for a compiler as for an
		  interpreter. A number of language constructs and
		  features are compiled: expressions, CBV and CBN
		  evaluation of lambda-expressions, dynamic scoping,
		  and various imperative features. The treatment of
		  recursive procedures is outlined as well. The
		  resulting method allows compilers to be constructed
		  in a mix-and-match fashion just as in a
		  monad-structured interpreter."

Abstract. DJ is a new pure-Java library for adaptive programming that allows traversal strategies to be constructed and interpreted dynamically at run-time, as opposed to existing adaptive programming tools that are strictly static. Traversal strategies can be used with adaptive visitors (similar to the Visitor pattern) or in a generic programming style by adapting them to the Java Collections framework. The DJ library makes heavy use of Java reflection and we give some details of this implementation. }

		ABSTRACT. Active networks represent a new
		  approach to network architecture. Routers can
		  perform computations on user data, while packets can
		  carry programs to be executed on routers and
		  possibly change their state. Currently, the research
		  community is divided concerning the usefulness of
		  active networks. On the one hand, active networks
		  provide a much more flexible network infrastructure,
		  with increased capabilities. On the other hand, they
		  are obviously more complex than traditional networks
		  and raise considerable security issues. The purpose
		  of this article is to provide a broad survey on
		  active networks. The first goal is to highlight
		  their efficiency in a variety of applications. After
		  presenting some key points on each application, we
		  discuss some current experimental technologies and
		  assess the usefulness of active networks in
		  congestion control, multicasting, caching, and
		  network management. The second goal is to address
		  the security issues that active networks raise: the
		  problem is defined, and techniques for solving it
		  are presented and elaborated upon with a description
		  of a specific implementation of a secure environment
		  and related performance measures. Issues related to
		  the design of a programming language for active
		  networks are also discussed. The third goal is to
		  classify active network architectures based on their
		  design approach. Thus an inclusive presentation of
		  currently proposed architectures, which focuses on
		  their design attributes, capabilities, performance,
		  and security, is given. "

abstract={
The actor model is a natural starting point for a semantic theory that
treats both heterogeneity and modularity (encapsulation and
composability) in distributed systems.  This paper begins with some
simple examples of actor systems that illustrate the essential
features of actor based computation, and the interactions and
combinations of components these systems.  We then present a semantic
theory that formalizes these notions.  A notion of abstract actor
structure (AAS) is introduced that characterizes the minimal semantic
requirements for an actor language and allows for components to be
defined using multiple languages.  Next, a modular operational
semantics is derived from the local rules for behavior of individual
actors given in an AAS.  This semantics accounts for both internal
computation and interaction of a component with its environment.  Next
we abstract away from details of internal computation and define a
notion of interaction semantics.  This allows us to reason about
equivalence of actor system components considered as black boxes.
Finally, an algebra of components and their interaction semantics is
defined.  This provides a basis for reasoning about construction and
transformation of components implemented as actor systems.

		abstract. The introduction of parametric polymorphism
		  in Java with translation approaches has been shown
		  to be of considerable interest, allowing the
		  definition of extensions of Java on top of the
		  existing Virtual Machines. Homogeneous translations
		  furthermore, seem to be more useful than
		  heterogeneous, avoiding the continuous increase of
		  library code with redundant information. At this
		  time however, homogeneous approaches aren't as
		  flexible as heterogeneous, with extensions failing
		  to integrate well with base language typing. In this
		  paper, using some of the features of the Core
		  Reflection of Java, we introduce a homogeneous
		  translation in which run-time information about
		  instantiation of type-parameters is carried,
		  allowing full integration of parameterized types
		  with Java typing. Performance overhead is highly
		  decreased using a brand new translation technique
		  based on the deferring of the management of type
		  information at load-time. The same power and
		  flexibility of previous heterogeneous approaches is
		  obtained while maintaining homogeneous translation
		  advantages. "
