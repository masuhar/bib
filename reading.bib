@InProceedings{kienzle2002ecoop,
  author = 	 {J{\"o}rg Kienzle and Rachid Guerraoui},
  title = 	 {{AOP}: Does It Make Sense? The Case of Concurrency and Failures},
  crossref =	 {ecoop2002},
  key =		 {Aspect-oriented programming, abstraction, objects, concurrency, failures, exceptions, transactions},
  pages =	 {37--?},
  annote =	 {printed jul 2002; general interests},
  abstract = {Concurrency and failures are fundamental problems in
	distributed computing. One likes to think that the mechanisms
	needed to address these problems can be separated from the
	rest of the distributed application: in modern words, these
	mechanisms could be aspectized. Does this however make sense?

	This paper relates an experience that conveys our initial and
	indeed biased intuition that the answer is in general
	no. Except for simple academic examples, it is hard and even
	potentially dangerous to separate concurrency control and
	failure management from the actual application.

	We point out the very facts that (1) an aspect-oriented
	language can, pretty much like a macro language, be beneficial
	for code factorization (but should be reserved to experienced
	programmers), and (2) concurrency and failures are
	particularly hard to aspectize because they are usually part
	of the phenomenon that objects should simulate. They are in
	this sense different than other concerns, like for instance
	tracing, which might be easier to aspectize. }

@InProceedings{meseguer2002ecoop,
  author = 	 {Jose Meseguer and Carolyn Talcott},
  title = 	 {Semantic Models for Distributed Object Reflection},
  crossref =	 {ecoop2002},
  pages =	 {1--.},
  note =	 {invited talk},
  annote =	 {printed jul 2002; general interests},
  abstract= {A generic formal model of distributed object reflection
	  is proposed, that combines logical reflection with a
	  structuring of distributed objects as nested configurations
	  of metaobject that can control subobjects under them. The
	  model provides mathematical models for a good number of
	  existing models of distributed reflection and of reflective
	  middleware. To illustrate the ideas, we show in some detail
	  how two important models of distributed actor reflection can
	  be naturally obtained as special cases of our generic model,
	  and discuss how several recent models of reflective
	  middleware can be likewise formalized as instances of our
	  model. }

@InProceedings{zenger2002ecoop,
  author = 	 {Matthias Zenger},
  title = 	 {Type-Safe Prototype-Based Component Evolution},
  crossref =	 {ecoop2002},
  pages =	 {470--??},
  annote =	 {printed jul 2002; general interests},

  abstract = {Component-based programming is currently carried out
	using mainstream object-oriented languages. These languages
	have to be used in a highly disciplined way to guarantee
	flexible component composition and extensibility. This paper
	investigates abstractions for component-oriented programming
	on the programming language level. We propose a simple
	prototype-based model for first-class components on top of a
	class-based object-oriented language. The model is formalized
	as an extension of Featherweight Java. Our calculus includes a
	minimal set of primitives to dynamically build, extend, and
	compose software components, while supporting features like
	explicit context dependencies, late composition, unanticipated
	component extensibility, and strong encapsulation. We present
	a type system for our calculus that ensures type-safe
	component definition, composition, and evolution. }

@InProceedings{aldrich2002ecoop,
  author = 	 {Jonathan Aldrich and Craig Chambers and David Notkin},
  title = 	 {Architectural Reasoning in ArchJava},
  crossref =	 {ecoop2002},
  pages =	 {334--??},
  annote =	 {printed jul 2002; general interests},

  abstract = {Software architecture describes the structure of a
	system, enabling more effective design, program understanding,
	and formal analysis. However, existing approaches decouple
	implementation code from architecture, allowing
	inconsistencies that cause confusion, violate architectural
	properties, and inhibit software evolution. We are developing
	ArchJava, an extension to Java that seamlessly unifies
	software architecture with an object-oriented
	implementation. In this paper, we show how ArchJava's type
	system ensures that implementation code conforms to
	architectural constraints. A case study applying ArchJava to
	an Islamic tile design application demonstrates that ArchJava
	can express dynamically changing architectures effectively
	within implementation code, and suggests that the resulting
	program may be easier to understand and evolve. }

  title = 	 {Modern Concurrency Abstractions for {C\#}},
  crossref =	 {ecoop2002},

  annote =	 {printed jul 2002; general interests},
  abstract = {Polyphonic C is an extension of the C language with new
	  asynchronous concurrency constructs, based on the join
	  calculus. We describe the design and implementation of the
	  language and give examples of its use in addressing a range
	  of concurrent programming problems. }
